Node Module System
 - Allows the developer to load functionality into the app and use it to complete tasks
 - Three ways
    1. core node modules
    2. third party modules
    3. created from the developer


~~~~~~~~~
Core Modules
- Some modules are available globally
- Others are required to be loaded in.

~~~~~~~~~
File System Module
- allows the developer to gain access to the operating systems file system
- Asynchronous vs. Synchronous

.writeFileSync = two arguments
1. name of the file that you write to
2. the data that you write
    - responsible for writing data to a file
        - if the file doesn't exist, it'll be created
        - if it does exist, it will be overwritten

Require Function: 
    - how the developer loads in other things
    - node module
    - npm module
    - a user created File

appendFileSync
- the name of the file you are trying to append

~~~~~~~~~~

Importing my own File

when we pass a file to node, only that file executes
if you want another file to run, you have to require the file to be loaded in.

All files (modules) have their own scope

Export
    - module.exports 
    - whatever is assigned is what is exported.
    - exporting a function


Do not edit node modules editor

chalk
- a utility that customizes how text is printed in the console.


Section 4.
command - what action you are trying to take when loading the program
process.argv  = a property in Node.js that provides an array containing the command-line arguments passed when the Node.js
process is launced.
allows for a node.js application to access and utilize information provided by the user or another process at the time of execution

yargs.parse()
json.strigify


Arrow Functions

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Call Stack:
- Work in tandem
- Simple data structure
- Tracks the execution of the program, and does this by counting all of the functions that are running
- Think of a can of tennis balls, you can only put the top in or out.

Callback Queue:
- 

Event Loop:
- 

~~~~~~~~

Weather App 
- Setting up a query string = ?
- npm init -y : answers yes 

A stack trace, also known as a backtrace, is a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during a program's execution. It provides a list of the function or method calls that are currently on the call stack, in reverse order of their invocation (most recent call first).

error handling: The process of detecting, managing and responding to unexpected situations or anomalies that occur during the execution program or system
